* ```<Piece />``` components are displayed based on coordinates.
  * Each will handle when the user ***clicks*** and ***drags***

* ```<Spot />``` components are rendered representing the checkers of the board
    * Each will display a ***highlight*** circle if a piece can move there

> Users drag and drop a piece each turn, and the ```gameStateArray``` will save that move.
